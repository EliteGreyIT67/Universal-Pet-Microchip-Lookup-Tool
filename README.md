## Overview

This web application helps identify potential manufacturers or issuing companies of a pet's microchip based on its number format. It serves as a quick, client-side reference tool for individuals such as veterinary staff, shelter workers, or anyone who finds a lost pet.

The core data for this tool is based on the guide provided by MicrochipHelp.com.

The core data for this tool is transcribed from the ‚Äú[MICROCHIP FORMAT GUIDE](https://www.microchiphelp.com/uploads/9/9/7/3/9973230/format_03-29-2025.pdf)‚Äù by MicrochipHelp.com.

> **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**  
> This tool does **not** check live pet registration databases and **cannot** provide any pet owner information. It only suggests the likely manufacturer or brand associated with a microchip number.  
> **Always use official resources and the "Advanced Help" section for a complete owner lookup.**
