## Overview

This web application helps identify potential manufacturers or issuing companies of a pet's microchip based on its number format. It serves as a quick, client-side reference tool for individuals such as veterinary staff, shelter workers, or anyone who finds a lost pet.

The core data for this tool is based on the guide provided by MicrochipHelp.com.

The core data for this tool is transcribed from the ‚Äú[MICROCHIP FORMAT GUIDE](https://www.microchiphelp.com/uploads/9/9/7/3/9973230/format_03-29-2025.pdf)‚Äù by MicrochipHelp.com.

> **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**  
> This tool does **not** check live pet registration databases and **cannot** provide any pet owner information. It only suggests the likely manufacturer or brand associated with a microchip number.  
> **Always use official resources and the "Advanced Help" section for a complete owner lookup.**

## Critical Next Steps

If you‚Äôve found a lost pet, use this tool to identify the chip company, then:

1. ‚úÖ **Use the Direct Registry Lookups:**
   The tool provides a list of direct links to major registries (PetLink, HomeAgain, etc.). Use them first

2. ‚òëÔ∏è **AAHA Universal Pet Microchip Lookup:** [www.petmicrochiplookup.org](https://www.petmicrochiplookup.org)  
   Searches many North American pet recovery databases.

3. üÜò **For Dead-End or Unregistered Chips:**
   Use the resources in the "Advanced Help" section of the tool. This includes forms to request assistance from The Microchip Hunters, a volunteer group that specializes in tracing hard-to-find owners.

4. ‚òëÔ∏è **PetChip.info:**  
   [www.petchip.info](https://www.petchip.info)  
   For registries not in the AAHA tool.

5. üåé **International Databases:**  
   - [Europetnet](https://www.europetnet.com)
   - [PetMaxx](https://www.petmaxx.com)
