## Overview

This web application helps identify the likely manufacturer or brand of a pet's microchip based on its number. It is designed as a quick, client-side reference for veterinary staff, shelter workers, and anyone who has found a lost pet. The core data is transcribed from the ‚Äú[MICROCHIP FORMAT GUIDE](https://www.microchiphelp.com/uploads/9/9/7/3/9973230/format_03-29-2025.pdf)‚Äù by MicrochipHelp.com.

> **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** > This tool does **not** check live pet registration databases and **cannot** provide any pet owner information. It is only a reference to suggest the likely company associated with a microchip number.  
> **Always use official resources like the AAHA Universal Lookup for a complete owner search.**

## üÜò Critical Next Steps for a Found Pet

If you have found a lost pet, use this tool to identify the chip company, then follow these steps:

1.  ‚úÖ **Use the AAHA Universal Pet Microchip Lookup:**
    * [**www.petmicrochiplookup.org**](https://www.petmicrochiplookup.org) ‚Äî This should be your first stop. It searches most major North American pet recovery databases at once.

2.  ‚òëÔ∏è **Try the Direct Registry Lookups:**
    * If AAHA doesn't yield a result, use the direct links provided by this tool (e.g., PetLink, HomeAgain) based on the identified manufacturer.

3.  üÜò **For Dead-End or Unregistered Chips (Advanced Help):**
    * Use the resources in the **"Advanced Help"** section of the tool. This includes a link to request assistance from **The Microchip Hunters**, a volunteer group that specializes in tracing hard-to-find owners.

4.  üåê **Check Other Databases:**
    * **International:** [Europetnet](https://www.europetnet.com), [PetMaxx](https://www.petmaxx.com)
    * **Other Lookups:** [PetChip.info](https://www.petchip.info) (for registries not in the AAHA tool)

**Q: Does this tool show owner information?** A: **No.** For privacy and security, this tool only provides likely manufacturer/brand information to guide your next search steps.

**Q: What if the chip number isn't found in this tool?** A: An unknown prefix does not mean the chip is invalid. It simply means it's not in our reference guide. You should **always** proceed to the "Critical Next Steps" and use the AAHA universal lookup.
